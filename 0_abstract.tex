Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition, MOEA/D, decomposes a multi-objective problem into single-objective subproblems. All these subproblems are uniformly treated, i.e, there is no priority among them and are related to an area of the theoretical Pareto Front. It is expected that different areas would be more difficult to find approximations that other areas leading to an unbalanced exploration of the search space. To balance this exploration, utility functions have been successfully used over the last years. In this work an experimental investigation was conducted to analyze a new proposed utility function based on an on-line diversity metric. A preliminary experimental analysis on a group of benchmark functions and in on the problem of selecting the optimal landing site for the lunar landing exploration mission was conducted in which the proposed algorithm was compared with two MOEA/D variants, MOEA/D-DE an MOEA/D-GRA. The results validate that the proposed algorithm is very competitive.
